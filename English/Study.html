			<br/><u>Main Idea and Theme:</u> </p>
<p style=text-align:center;font-size:35px;>
			<br/><u>Main Idea</u></p> 
<p style=text-align:center;font-size:25px>
			The main idea of the story is of a character with a painful past overcoming it. The whole story is of Holden’s getting over his brother’s death. This is the painful past. The overcoming of it comes with the rest of the story. The entire story sees him messing around, never thinking of the future (and when he does, its very idealistic), and always childish. He never grew up till the last handful of chapters. The story follows his growth as a character, with him growing up, especially with the last five or so chapters. Once Holden meets Phoebe, Phoebe brings reality back to him. He got kicked out, and he needs to do something about it. Him handing over his hunting hat at the end symbolized him finally completely realizing that he needed to grow up, and so he did. He is leaving the protections of childhood, his hat, in Phoebe's care. </p>
<p style=text-align:center;font-size:35px;>
			<br/><u>Theme</u></p> 
<p style=text-align:center;font-size:25px>
			The theme of the story is the harsh, painfulness of growing up. In the story, as mentioned within the main idea, Holden does not want to grow up. He stays away from his home, he stays away from his maturity, instead vying to stick with his childish nature. This does not help him. He doesn’t grow up, he never grows up (until the end), all because of Allie’s death, but once he does grow up, he’s freed. He gets over his harsh past, over all his wrongdoings, over getting kicked out, and decides that he needs to just take a step forward in life. It may be hard and hurt at first, but that’s what he has to do, and that’s why it’s the theme. His growth and ultimate decision all swayed with the fact that he had to grow up, and the fact that he knew it. It also shows his growth and decision to do such an action, and the positive outcomes of it, almost creating a sort of propaganda for growing up, through all the hardships and pain.</p>
