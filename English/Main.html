			Welcome to the totally official Catcher in the Rye (book not the movie) website! This site was made in an effort to get an A, and to inform the ignorant masses of the truth. In this website are a series of Web Pages all linked together. With this website will come the end of old and the beginning of new, now introducing.... The poorly made Catcher in the Rye website!<br/>

		<br/> The Catcher in The Rye book is a very boring book. The whole story features a character by the name of Holden recalling his actions prior to his departure to a mental ward. That is all. The book features him going from place to place doing whatever he feels like doing at the time. It is important to mention what is going on in the background however, and that is that he is recounting about his downward spiral in life. He goes from a happy go lucky, normal guy, then to a depressed mound not wishing to continue with schooling (after his brother's death), then to just a depressing, depressed guy. That is the downward spiral he goes through throughout the span of the entire book (although the initial stage had not been featured until a recounting (inside his recounting) of his love for his brother, Allie, and the innocent life he had while Allie was alive). For the first few chapters of the book, the reader is introduced to the party-pooping Holden who butts heads with his roommates. It introduces his character as somebody who just wants to be alone and away from all the buzz around. It also introduces him as a hothead, especially when he gets into a fight involving the topic of his childhood crush, Jane Galligher. Therefore, due to his chill personality, he is completely fine with leaving (he was failing out already, and made no effort to fix that), telling himself that it's everybody else that makes him want to leave, not demotivation of life. After this, the reader is introduced to his escapades in New York, with him going randomly to (what it seems to be) randomly picked places. He goes to a hotel, a bar, an ice-skating rink, a museum, central park, and his house (He also went to several other places, too many to list without boring the reader, you). Though, it is what he does in these places that is special, and not just the places themselves that are special. In those places, the readers gets a direct view into his character, and his utter loneliness. At the hotel, he hired a prostitute, just to speak too. At the bar, he joined a random group just to speak to (and he even paid for their drinks just to keep them with him). At Central Park, he reminisced about his time with his family (DB, Allie, Phoebe) and the music gifted by his little sister. At the museum, he does the same, accept only his sister and not the rest of his family. He even goes on a date just because he is desperate for attention. The list goes on. At one point, he goes to his house. Once he talks to his sister, things start to change. The gears start to turn. He discusses with his sister and leaves, feeling that his sister was right, but not wanting to admit it. Then he goes to Mr. Antolini's, the only teacher who symphosized with him, and is made fun of (what Holden believes). Mr. Antolini and his crude, unhomely house serve to display how Holden would end up if continuing down his path. Antolini knows this, and so advises Holden against doing exactly that, going down the same path. After, Holden would go back to his home and decide one big thing, the gears finished turning. He was going to put effort back into his life. That is where the story ends off, with him in the mental hospital, finishing his story.

The story is overall bad. It follows Holden's life and his drooping around, always stating about how stupid he is and that he knows it. To me, Holden is insufferable. I hate how he does that, over and over and over, and I realize that it is to enforce the fact that his life is terrible, but to me, its just annoying. It almost feels like the main plot point of the book is explaining his depression, not about explaining the actual plot. When I think back to this story, I don't think about a guy named Holden falling into depression and rising up from it, stronger! no. I think of a guy named Holden falling into depression and showing off that fact, almost like it's a medal to him. I hate his character's lack of drive, and again, that is reasonable to the plot, however that also makes his almost flexing his depression so much worse. This is exactly the problem with the story, Holden is a terrible character, and the settings feel so randomly picked too. Swap out any setting (other than Central Park) with another, and nothing changes. What if he went out to a club instead of the hotel and hired a prostitute there, would anything change? No. Stories need to be linked with their settings to reach their full potential, and yet JD Salindinger grabbed a dart and threw it (he obviously didn't, but still). A good author will take a setting and weave it into the story, making the story better and giving the setting a reason to be there. Again, the dart. For instance, take a franchise like Mario. Would that game nearly have gotten as popular without the Mushroom kingdom? No. The wackiness and creativity which stems from a completely separate, detached world led to its success (and also being bundled in with the NES for the longest time). Now, Mario can't be imagined without the Mushroom kingdom. Holden though? I could imagine Holden at a grocery store. That is not what an author is supposed to do. The author is supposed to give such a defined experience that when you automatically think of a character, you think of the unchangeable setting and their characteristics. Lord of the Rings is Middle Earth, Alien is outer space, but Catcher in the Rye? New York. Imagine Lord of the Rings happening in California. It wouldn't nearly make the same impact as Middle Earth, and that's because the setting was specifically tailored to help the series out. I could imagine Holden running around in the Great Plains, California, China, Mexico, anywhere. That is inherently bad design.
